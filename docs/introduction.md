# Introduction

RUKA-V2 is a tendon-driven robotic hand designed for research in dexterous manipulation, learning-based control, and human-robot interaction.

The system emphasizes:
- modular mechanical design
- tendon transmission for compact actuation
- reproducibility through detailed documentation

This guide documents the **physical assembly process**, not the learning or control algorithms.

## Scope
This manual covers:
- Mechanical assembly
- Electrical wiring and power-up
- Sensor and actuator calibration
- Basic functional verification

It does **not** cover:
- High-level control policies
- Learning pipelines
- Dataset generation
