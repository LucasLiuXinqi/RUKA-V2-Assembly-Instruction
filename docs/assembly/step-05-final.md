## Final Assembly Steps

### 5.1 Cable Organization

1. **Bundle servo cables**
   - Group cables logically (by finger or by function)
   - Use cable ties at regular intervals
   - Leave service loops for maintenance
   - Keep bundles neat and compact

2. **Label all cables**
   - Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky
   - Number servos 1-5 for easy identification
   - Use heat shrink tubing with labels
   - Document cable color coding

3. **Secure cable routing**
   - Use adhesive cable mounts
   - Avoid interference with moving parts
   - Protect cables from abrasion
   - Plan route for electronics connection

### 5.2 Install Protective Elements

1. **Add protective covers (if provided)**
   - Palm cover to protect internal components
   - Wrist cable guard
   - Finger tip protectors

2. **Secure with appropriate hardware**
   - Use M3 screws for plastic covers
   - Don't overtighten on thin covers
   - Ensure covers don't interfere with motion

### 5.3 Final Mechanical Inspection

1. **Visual inspection**
   - Check all screws are tight
   - Verify no loose parts
   - Look for wear or stress marks
   - Ensure clean appearance

2. **Functional testing**
   - Manually actuate each finger
   - Test full range of motion
   - Check for smooth operation
   - Listen for unusual sounds

3. **Tendon system check**
   - Verify tension is still correct
   - Check all connection points
   - Look for fraying or damage
   - Test pull strength

### 5.4 Pre-Electronics Preparation

1. **Servo cable preparation**
   - Verify all connectors are intact
   - Check cable lengths are adequate
   - Note servo positions for calibration
   - Clean any adhesive residue

2. **Mounting verification**
   - Confirm wrist mount is secure
   - Test mounting on arm or stand
   - Verify orientation
   - Check stability

### 5.5 Documentation

1. **Take reference photos**
   - Overall assembly views (front, back, sides)
   - Close-ups of cable routing
   - Servo positions and labels
   - Any custom modifications

2. **Record assembly notes**
   - Special adjustments made
   - Tendon tensions (if measurable)
   - Part version numbers
   - Build date and builder

3. **Create configuration file**
   - Servo assignments
   - Direction of rotation
   - Mechanical limits
   - Any offsets or calibration notes

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Structural Integrity
- [ ] All screws are properly tightened
- [ ] No loose or rattling components
- [ ] Joints move smoothly without binding
- [ ] No visible cracks or damage

### Tendon System
- [ ] All tendons are securely attached
- [ ] Proper tension on all fingers
- [ ] No fraying or damage to tendons
- [ ] Smooth operation through full range

### Cable Management
- [ ] Cables are neatly organized
- [ ] All cables are labeled
- [ ] No cables interfere with motion
- [ ] Adequate length for connections

### Mounting
- [ ] Wrist mount is secure
- [ ] Proper orientation verified
- [ ] Stable when mounted
- [ ] Ready for electronics

### Documentation
- [ ] Photos taken
- [ ] Assembly notes recorded
- [ ] Configuration documented
- [ ] Known issues noted

## Final Mechanical Tests

### Test 1: Individual Finger Motion
**Procedure:**
1. Manually flex each finger fully
2. Release and verify it returns to neutral
3. Check for smooth motion throughout range
4. Note any resistance or binding

**Pass criteria:** All fingers move smoothly through full range

### Test 2: Multi-Finger Coordination
**Procedure:**
1. Flex all fingers simultaneously
2. Release together
3. Try various grip patterns
4. Check for interference

**Pass criteria:** No finger-to-finger interference

### Test 3: Tendon Durability
**Procedure:**
1. Rapidly flex and extend each finger 10 times
2. Check tendon connections
3. Verify tension hasn't changed
4. Look for wear

**Pass criteria:** No loosening or damage after rapid cycling

### Test 4: Structural Stability
**Procedure:**
1. Shake hand gently
2. Apply light pressure to palm
3. Twist wrist mount slightly
4. Listen for rattles

**Pass criteria:** No loose components detected

## Troubleshooting Before Electronics

### Issue: Finger Doesn't Move Smoothly
**Check:**
- Joint tightness
- Tendon routing
- Debris in joints
- Alignment

### Issue: Tendon Feels Loose
**Solution:**
- Re-tension tendon at servo horn
- Check crimp integrity
- Verify routing

### Issue: Parts Seem Loose
**Solution:**
- Identify loose component
- Tighten appropriate screws
- Add threadlocker if necessary
- Check for damaged threads

## Preparation for Next Phase
