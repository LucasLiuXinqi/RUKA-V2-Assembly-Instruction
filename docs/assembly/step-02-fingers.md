# Step 2: Finger Assembly

Each RUKA-V2 finger consists of three segments (proximal, medial, and distal) connected by joints. You will build five complete finger assemblies.

## Required Parts (Per Finger)

### 3D Printed Components
- [ ] Proximal segment (1x)
- [ ] Medial segment (1x)
- [ ] Distal segment (1x)
- [ ] Joint pins (2x)

### Hardware (Per Finger)
- [ ] M3 x 16mm screws (2x)
- [ ] M3 x 12mm screws (4x)
- [ ] M3 nuts (4x)
- [ ] Small bearings or bushings (2x)

### Tools
- Phillips screwdriver #0
- Hex key 2.5mm
- Needle-nose pliers
- Tweezers

## Assembly Steps

### 2.1 Prepare Finger Components

1. **Clean all printed parts**
   - Remove support material carefully
   - Clean joint surfaces
   - Test-fit joints before assembly
   - Smooth any rough edges with sandpaper

2. **Organize parts by finger**
   - Separate parts for each finger
   - Label if necessary (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky)
   - Note: Thumb may have different dimensions

### 2.2 Assemble Distal-Medial Joint

1. **Connect distal to medial segment**
   - Align the joint surfaces
   - Insert bearing or bushing into joint
   - Thread joint pin through both segments
   - Secure with M3 x 16mm screw
   - Add M3 nut on opposite side
   - Tighten until snug but joint moves freely

2. **Test joint movement**
   - Joint should rotate smoothly
   - Full range of motion (0-90 degrees typical)
   - No excessive play or wobble

> **Important**: The joint must move freely but not be loose. Adjust tightness as needed.

### 2.3 Assemble Medial-Proximal Joint

1. **Connect medial to proximal segment**
   - Follow same process as distal-medial joint
   - Align joint surfaces carefully
   - Insert bearing or bushing
   - Secure with M3 x 16mm screw and nut

2. **Test both joints together**
   - Verify smooth articulation
   - Check that segments don't interfere
   - Ensure joint alignment is correct

### 2.4 Install Tendon Routing

1. **Thread tendon guides**
   - Locate tendon channels in each segment
   - Insert small guide tubes if provided
   - Ensure clear path from tip to base
   - Secure guides with M3 x 12mm screws

2. **Test with dummy tendon**
   - Thread a string through the full length
   - Pull to test resistance
   - Verify smooth routing without binding

### 2.5 Complete All Five Fingers

1. **Repeat for each finger**
   - Thumb (special size/shape)
   - Index finger
   - Middle finger
   - Ring finger
   - Pinky finger

2. **Quality check each finger**
   - Smooth joint movement
   - Proper alignment
   - No loose hardware
   - Tendon channels clear

## Finger-Specific Notes

### Thumb Assembly
- May have different segment proportions
- Often includes additional rotation joint at base
- Check orientation carefully

### Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky
- Generally identical construction
- May vary slightly in length
- Maintain consistent joint tightness across all fingers

## Assembly Tips

- **Joint Tightness**: The "Goldilocks" principle applies - not too tight, not too loose
- **Alignment**: Use a flat surface to ensure fingers don't twist
- **Tendon Routing**: Keep channels smooth to reduce friction
- **Quality Control**: Test each finger thoroughly before moving on

## Common Issues

### Joints Too Tight
- Loosen screw slightly
- Check for debris in joint
- Sand joint surfaces if needed

### Joints Too Loose
- Tighten screw slightly
- Check for worn parts
- Add washer for better clamping

### Tendon Won't Route Smoothly
- Clear channels of debris
- Use lubricant sparingly
- Check for pinch points

## Verification Checklist

Before proceeding, verify:
- [ ] All 5 fingers are fully assembled
- [ ] Each finger has smooth joint movement
- [ ] Tendon channels are clear in all fingers
- [ ] No loose hardware or parts
- [ ] Fingers are properly labeled (optional)

## Next Steps

With all fingers assembled, you're ready to install the tendon system.
