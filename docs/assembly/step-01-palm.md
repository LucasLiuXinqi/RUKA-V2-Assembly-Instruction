# Step 1: Palm Assembly

The palm is the foundation of the RUKA-V2 robotic hand. It houses the servo motors and provides the structural base for attaching fingers.

## Required Parts

### 3D Printed Components
- [ ] Palm base (1x)
- [ ] Servo motor mounts (5x)
- [ ] Cable routing guides (as needed)

### Hardware
- [ ] M3 x 12mm screws (20x)
- [ ] M3 nuts (20x)
- [ ] M3 x 8mm screws (10x)
- [ ] Servo motors (5x)
- [ ] Bearings 608 (5x)

### Tools
- Phillips screwdriver #1
- Hex key 2.5mm
- Needle-nose pliers

## Assembly Steps

### 1.1 Prepare the Palm Base

1. **Clean the 3D printed palm base**
   - Remove any support material
   - Clean out screw holes with a 3mm drill bit if needed
   - Ensure all surfaces are smooth

2. **Inspect for quality**
   - Check for warping or damage
   - Verify all mounting holes are clear
   - Test-fit bearings in their seats

### 1.2 Install Bearings

1. **Press-fit bearings into palm base**
   - Locate the 5 bearing seats on the palm
   - Press each 608 bearing firmly into place
   - Ensure bearings sit flush with the surface
   - Bearings should rotate freely

> **Tip**: If bearings are too tight, gently sand the seats. If too loose, use a small amount of adhesive.

### 1.3 Mount Servo Motors

1. **Position first servo motor**
   - Align servo with the designated mount (thumb position)
   - Insert servo shaft through palm base
   - Ensure proper orientation (cable exit towards palm interior)

2. **Secure with servo mount bracket**
   - Place servo mount over the motor
   - Insert 4x M3 x 12mm screws
   - Tighten gradually in a cross pattern
   - Do not overtighten

3. **Repeat for remaining servos**
   - Install remaining 4 servos (one per finger)
   - Maintain consistent orientation
   - Label each servo (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky)

> **Important**: Leave servo cables accessible for later wiring.

### 1.4 Install Cable Routing Guides

1. **Attach cable guides**
   - Position guides along the cable paths
   - Secure with M3 x 8mm screws
   - Leave enough slack for movement

2. **Test servo movement**
   - Manually rotate each servo (unpowered)
   - Verify smooth rotation
   - Check for any binding or interference

### 1.5 Verify Assembly

**Quality checks:**
- [ ] All 5 servos are securely mounted
- [ ] Bearings rotate freely
- [ ] No parts interfere with servo movement
- [ ] Cables are organized and accessible
- [ ] All screws are tightened appropriately

## Common Issues

### Servos Won't Fit
- Check for support material in mounting holes
- Verify you have the correct servo model
- Ensure proper orientation

### Bearings Are Loose
- Use a small amount of cyanoacrylate (CA) glue
- Or use heat to slightly expand the plastic seat

### Screws Strip Threads
- Don't overtighten
- Consider using heat-set inserts for better threads

## Next Steps

With the palm assembly complete, you're ready to build the fingers.
