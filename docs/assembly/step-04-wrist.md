# Step 4: Wrist Assembly

The wrist assembly provides the mounting interface between the RUKA-V2 hand and a robotic arm or test stand. This step is relatively quick but important for proper integration.

## Required Parts

### Components
- [ ] Assembled hand with tendons (from Steps 1-3)
- [ ] Wrist adapter plate (3D printed)
- [ ] Wrist mounting bracket (3D printed)
- [ ] Mounting flange (optional, depends on arm interface)

### Hardware
- [ ] M3 x 20mm screws (4x)
- [ ] M3 x 12mm screws (6x)
- [ ] M3 nuts (4x)
- [ ] M4 x 25mm screws (4x, for arm mounting)
- [ ] M4 nuts (4x)
- [ ] Washers as needed

### Tools
- Phillips screwdriver #1
- Hex key 2.5mm and 3mm
- Wrench 7mm (for M4 nuts)
- Level (optional, for alignment)

## Assembly Steps

### 4.1 Prepare Wrist Components

1. **Clean 3D printed wrist parts**
   - Remove any support material
   - Clear all mounting holes
   - Test fit parts together
   - Check for warping or defects

2. **Organize hardware**
   - Separate screws by size
   - Have nuts and washers ready
   - Keep tools within reach

### 4.2 Attach Wrist Adapter to Palm

1. **Position wrist adapter**
   - Align adapter with palm base bottom
   - Ensure proper orientation (check for alignment marks)
   - Verify cable routing won't be blocked

2. **Secure with screws**
   - Insert 4x M3 x 20mm screws from bottom
   - Thread into palm base
   - Tighten in cross pattern
   - Ensure firm connection

3. **Verify attachment**
   - Check for any movement or play
   - Ensure adapter is perpendicular to palm
   - Verify fingers can still move freely

### 4.3 Install Mounting Bracket

1. **Attach mounting bracket to adapter**
   - Position bracket on wrist adapter
   - Align mounting holes
   - Insert 6x M3 x 12mm screws
   - Tighten evenly

2. **Check cable clearance**
   - Verify servo cables are not pinched
   - Ensure cables can reach connection point
   - Organize cables neatly through wrist

### 4.4 Test Mount Interface

1. **Test mounting holes**
   - Verify M4 mounting holes are clear
   - Test fit with robotic arm flange (if available)
   - Check for proper alignment
   - Ensure adequate thread engagement

2. **Check orientation**
   - Verify hand orientation relative to mount
   - Confirm fingers face correct direction
   - Check rotation if adjustable

## Mounting Options

### Option A: Direct Arm Mount

**For robotic arm integration:**

1. Align hand wrist bracket with arm flange
2. Insert 4x M4 x 25mm screws
3. Add washers and nuts
4. Tighten gradually in cross pattern
5. Verify secure connection
6. Check cable routing through arm

### Option B: Test Stand Mount

**For testing and development:**

1. Create or use test stand base
2. Mount wrist bracket to stand
3. Ensure stable platform
4. Orient hand for easy testing
5. Provide cable management

### Option C: Custom Interface

**For custom applications:**

1. Use wrist adapter as reference
2. Design custom mounting plate
3. Maintain standard hole pattern
4. Consider cable routing needs
5. Test fit before finalizing

## Cable Management Through Wrist

1. **Route servo cables**
   - Bundle cables together
   - Use cable ties or sleeving
   - Leave slack for movement (if wrist articulates)
   - Protect cables from pinch points

2. **Plan for future connections**
   - Consider where electronics will be located
   - Leave adequate cable length
   - Label cables if needed
   - Use strain relief

## Verification Checklist

**Before proceeding, verify:**
- [ ] Wrist adapter is securely attached to palm
- [ ] Mounting bracket is firmly installed
- [ ] Mounting interface is aligned correctly
- [ ] Cables are properly routed through wrist
- [ ] Hand orientation is correct
- [ ] No movement or play in wrist assembly
- [ ] Fingers still have full range of motion

## Common Issues

### Wrist Assembly Wobbles
- Tighten all mounting screws
- Check for warped 3D printed parts
- Add washers for better clamping

### Mounting Holes Don't Align
- Verify correct wrist adapter version
- Check for print scaling issues
- May need to drill/enlarge holes slightly

### Cables Get Pinched
- Reroute cables through different path
- Add cable guides or grommets
- Leave more slack

### Hand Orientation Wrong
- Check assembly instructions for orientation marks
- May need to remount adapter in different position
- Verify with robotic arm interface specifications

## Next Steps

With the wrist assembled, you're ready for final assembly steps.
