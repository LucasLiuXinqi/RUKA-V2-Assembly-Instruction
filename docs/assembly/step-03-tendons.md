# Step 3: Tendon Installation

The tendon system connects the servo motors in the palm to the finger segments, enabling actuation. This step requires precision and patience.

## Required Parts

### Components
- [ ] Assembled palm (from Step 1)
- [ ] Assembled fingers (from Step 2, all 5)
- [ ] Tendon cable (1mm diameter, ~5 meters total)
- [ ] Tendon terminators/crimps (10x)
- [ ] Servo horns (5x)

### Hardware
- [ ] M3 x 8mm screws (for securing tendons)
- [ ] Cable crimping beads
- [ ] Heat shrink tubing (small diameter)

### Tools
- Wire cutters
- Crimping tool
- Lighter or heat gun (for heat shrink)
- Needle-nose pliers
- Ruler or measuring tape
- Scissors

## Before You Begin

### Understanding the Tendon System

Each finger is controlled by one servo motor through a tendon system:
- **Flexor tendon**: Pulls finger closed (active)
- **Extensor**: Spring or elastic return (passive, optional)

The tendon runs from:
1. Servo horn (palm)
2. Through palm base
3. Along proximal segment
4. Through medial segment
5. To distal segment tip

## Assembly Steps

### 3.1 Prepare Tendons

1. **Measure and cut tendons**
   - Thumb tendon: ~80cm
   - Index finger tendon: ~100cm
   - Middle finger tendon: ~110cm
   - Ring finger tendon: ~105cm
   - Pinky tendon: ~95cm

> **Note**: These lengths include extra for routing and attachment. Measure carefully.

2. **Prepare tendon ends**
   - Clean cut both ends
   - Add crimping bead to one end
   - Crimp securely
   - Test crimp strength by pulling

### 3.2 Attach Fingers to Palm

1. **Mount thumb**
   - Align thumb base with palm mounting point
   - Insert mounting screws
   - Ensure proper angle and orientation
   - Tighten securely

2. **Mount remaining fingers**
   - Install in order: Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky
   - Maintain even spacing
   - Verify alignment
   - Check that fingers can flex without interference

3. **Test finger movement**
   - Manually flex each finger
   - Verify smooth motion
   - Check for binding or collision

### 3.3 Route Tendons Through Fingers

#### For Each Finger (starting with thumb):

1. **Thread tendon from fingertip**
   - Start at distal segment tip
   - Thread through distal segment channel
   - Continue through medial segment
   - Route through proximal segment
   - Exit at finger base

> **Tip**: Use a thin wire as a guide to pull tendon through if needed.

2. **Route through palm**
   - Guide tendon through palm base channels
   - Route to corresponding servo position
   - Maintain clear path without kinks

3. **Attach to servo horn**
   - Install servo horn on servo shaft
   - Position horn at ~90 degrees (neutral)
   - Thread tendon through servo horn hole
   - Pull tendon taut

### 3.4 Set Tendon Tension

1. **Initial tensioning**
   - Pull tendon until finger slightly curls
   - Crimp tendon or tie off at servo horn
   - Cut excess tendon (leave ~1cm)
   - Secure with heat shrink tubing

2. **Fine tune tension**
   - Finger should rest in natural position
   - Should begin to curl with minimal servo rotation
   - Not so tight that finger can't extend fully
   - Not so loose that there's slack

> **Critical**: Proper tension is key to performance. Too tight: limited extension. Too loose: delayed response.

3. **Repeat for all fingers**
   - Maintain consistent tension across fingers
   - Test each finger's range of motion
   - Document servo horn positions

### 3.5 Secure All Connections

1. **Check all crimp points**
   - Ensure crimps are secure
   - Add adhesive if needed (cyanoacrylate)
   - Cover with heat shrink tubing

2. **Cable management**
   - Route excess cable neatly
   - Use cable ties for organization
   - Avoid sharp bends
   - Keep cables away from moving parts

## Testing

### 3.6 Manual Testing

1. **Test each finger individually**
   - Manually rotate each servo (unpowered)
   - Verify finger curls smoothly
   - Check for full range of motion
   - Listen for any unusual sounds

2. **Test all fingers together**
   - Close all fingers simultaneously
   - Open all fingers
   - Verify coordinated movement
   - Check for interference

### 3.7 Verify Installation

**Quality checks:**
- [ ] All 5 tendons are installed
- [ ] Fingers curl and extend smoothly
- [ ] Tendon tension is appropriate
- [ ] No loose connections
- [ ] Cables are neatly routed
- [ ] Servo horns are secure

## Common Issues

### Tendon Slips or Breaks
- Check crimp quality
- Use stronger cable or double strand
- Add adhesive to crimps

### Finger Doesn't Close Fully
- Increase tendon tension
- Check for binding in joints
- Verify tendon routing

### Finger Doesn't Open Fully
- Reduce tendon tension
- Add return spring if needed
- Check for obstructions

### Inconsistent Movement
- Verify consistent tension across all fingers
- Check tendon routing for snags
- Ensure servo horns are at same starting position

## Assembly Tips

- **Be Patient**: Tendon routing takes time
- **Test Frequently**: Check each finger as you go
- **Document Settings**: Note servo positions and tensions
- **Leave Slack**: Extra cable is better than too short
- **Use Helper Tools**: Tweezers and guides make routing easier

## Next Steps

With tendons installed and fingers operational, proceed to wrist assembly.
