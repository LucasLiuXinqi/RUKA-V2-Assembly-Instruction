# Assembly Overview

This section guides you through the complete mechanical assembly of the RUKA-V2 robotic hand. The assembly process is divided into five main steps for clarity and ease of construction.

## Assembly Process

The RUKA-V2 assembly follows a logical progression:

1. **[Palm Assembly](step-01-palm.md)** - Building the foundation
2. **[Finger Assembly](step-02-fingers.md)** - Constructing the five fingers
3. **[Tendon Installation](step-03-tendons.md)** - Installing the actuation system
4. **[Wrist Assembly](step-04-wrist.md)** - Mounting and connection
5. **[Final Assembly](step-05-final.md)** - Integration and finishing touches

## Before You Begin

### Preparation Checklist

- [ ] All parts from [BOM](../bom.md) are available
- [ ] All [tools](../tools.md) are ready
- [ ] Workspace is clean and organized
- [ ] Good lighting is available
- [ ] Safety equipment is on hand

### Time Estimate

- **Palm Assembly**: 1-2 hours
- **Finger Assembly**: 2-3 hours
- **Tendon Installation**: 1-2 hours
- **Wrist Assembly**: 30 minutes
- **Final Assembly**: 30-60 minutes

**Total estimated time**: 4-6 hours

## Assembly Tips

- **Work carefully**: Take your time with each step
- **Check alignment**: Ensure parts are properly aligned before tightening
- **Test as you go**: Verify movement and fit at each stage
- **Don't overtighten**: Snug is sufficient; overtightening can damage parts
- **Keep parts organized**: Use small containers for hardware

## Required Components Overview

### Main Structural Components
- Palm base assembly
- 5 complete finger assemblies
- Wrist mounting adapter
- Servo mounting brackets

### Hardware
- M3 screws (various lengths)
- M3 nuts
- Bearings
- Spacers

### Tools Needed
- Screwdriver set
- Hex keys
- Pliers
- Tweezers

## Assembly Sequence

Follow the steps in order for best results. Each step builds upon the previous one.

### Step 1: Palm Assembly
Start here to build the foundation of the hand. The palm houses the servo motors and provides mounting points for the fingers.

[Begin with Step 1: Palm Assembly →](step-01-palm.md)

### Step 2: Finger Assembly  
Construct all five finger assemblies. Each finger consists of three segments (proximal, medial, and distal).

[Proceed to Step 2: Finger Assembly →](step-02-fingers.md)

### Step 3: Tendon Installation
Install the tendon system that connects the servos to the fingers, enabling actuation.

[Continue to Step 3: Tendon Installation →](step-03-tendons.md)

### Step 4: Wrist Assembly
Mount the wrist adapter that allows the hand to be connected to a robotic arm or test stand.

[Move to Step 4: Wrist Assembly →](step-04-wrist.md)

### Step 5: Final Assembly
Complete the assembly with final adjustments and preparations for electronics integration.

[Finish with Step 5: Final Assembly →](step-05-final.md)

## After Mechanical Assembly

Once mechanical assembly is complete, proceed to:
- [Electronics Integration](../electronics/wiring.md)
- [System Calibration](../calibration/encoders.md)
